Real instructions and documentation to come later, but if you're feeling brave:

To install it you don't need any kind of conda env, just install python, then install diffusers with pip install --upgrade git+https://github.com/huggingface/diffusers

You'll need a huggingface token if you don't already have one (or alternatively download the local model for the SD1.4 for diffusers), then edit the params file as usual.

If running python g_diffuser_bot.py errors out with an import error you can try using pip install whatever to install it.

Good luck!
